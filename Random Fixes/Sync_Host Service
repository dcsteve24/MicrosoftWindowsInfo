#On Server 2016 I started having a service which couldnt start: Sync Host
#This service was tied to something called OneSync which syncs mailand other contact information to Microsoft for backup.
#In most environments, this is not desired on a server. However, attempting to disable it from Control Panel or Powershell led to Parameter Errors.
#So here are the following steps to disable the service once and for all.

1. Open the registry with regedit
2. Browse to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\OneSyncSvc
3. Change the "Start" value to 4 (Hexadecimal)
4. There may be another service right under it with random digits afterwards i.e. OneSyncSvc_3c9753. Do step 3 to it as well if there is.
